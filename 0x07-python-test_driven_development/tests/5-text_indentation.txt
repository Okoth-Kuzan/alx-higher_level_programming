How to Use text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a function ``text_indentation(text)`` to print a formatted text with new lines after specific characters.

Usage
=====

``text_indentation(text)`` prints the formatted text with two new lines after each '.', '?' and ':' character.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> sample_text = "Hello. How are you? I am good: Thanks!"
    >>> text_indentation(sample_text)
    Hello
    How are you
    I am good
    Thanks

The function properly handles spaces after these characters.

::

    >>> sample_text = "Hello.  How are you?     I am good:   Thanks!"
    >>> text_indentation(sample_text)
    Hello
    How are you
    I am good
    Thanks

Invalid Inputs
==================

``text_indentation()`` expects the argument to be a string.
If the argument is not a string, a TypeError is raised:

::

    >>> text_indentation(123)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: text must be a string
